Nemesis:
=======

A very simple game written in Python using the Pygame library.  

Nemesis was a final semester project for 15-112:Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science that I took at CMU-Qatar. The game was intended to be a top-down hacking sim/adventure game, however it's just an adventure game for now.

The map and the sprites in the game were drawn using [Piskel](www.piskelapp.com). Highly recommend it for creating retro video game art.

Running:
========

Open main.py to begin the game.

Controls:
========
Arrow keys to move character.  
'a' to place recursion bomb.  
's' to shoot recursion bomb. Player must be close to the bomb.  
'd' to throw a forloop for teleportation.

To-Do:
=====

-Add a boss to the final level.  
-The game is too hard, need to nerf some enemies or buff player.  
-Add more enemies.  
-Add more weaponry.  
-Add collectibles.  
-Add a Hacking interface for in-game?
